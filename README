Date::Calc::Iterator version 1.01
=================================

Date::Calc::Iterator lets you iterate over a range of dates; by default it
iterates day by day, but you can specify an integer step different
from 1 (day).

I didn't have time to test this module thoroughly, so comments on it
are gladly welcome.
